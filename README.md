  <b>:telescope: 2020 projects</b><br>
  I'm currently working on my third project with my school, a client project, an intranet for MÃ©diaTransports. 
  My two others projects are on my Github, the first one is a static website on the theme of space.
  The second one is a design website using <a href="https://github.com/harvardartmuseums">Harvard Art Museums </a> API.<br>

  I'm also working on several personal projects, including the creation of an application using <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/">Nasa</a> API. Don't hesitate to contact me, my projects are in privite on my school's github.<br>
</p>

<p>:computer: I am currently looking for an internship of 4 to 6 months (start on 01/03/2021).</p>
