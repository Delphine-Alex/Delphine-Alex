### My projects & goals

<br>
<p>
  <b>:telescope: 2025 goal</b>
  <br><br>
  ✨ My main goal for 2025 is to accelerate and consolidate my C skills by working on numerous projects, thanks to 42. Throughout the year, I will build a strong portfolio with projects like creating a custom shell, 
  developing video games by coding a lexer/parser, and more. 
  <br><br>
  I plan to start learning Golang, C++ and Assembly at the end of the year to further explore low-level programming and system internals.
</p>
<br>
<p>
  <b>:cyclone: 2024 goal</b>
  <br><br>
   The most important goal for me in 2024 was to learn C programming. I passed and successfully completed the <a href="https://42.fr" target="_blank">42 Paris</a> piscine in August 2024, and was selected to continue.
   This decision was driven by my desire to get closer to the machine, understand how it works, and become a better developer. At the same time, I earned my Master’s degree in Software Development and IoT 👩🏻‍🎓
   <br>
   <br>I also transitioned from an apprenticeship to a full-time position in the same company Odigo, but in a different department.
</p>
<br>
<p>
  <b>:sparkles: 2022-2023 goal</b>
  <br><br>
   I earned my Bachelor's degree in Software Development in 2022 👩🏻‍🎓 During that time, I explored various technologies such as Java, React, Node... However, software development and low-level programming 
  are what truly drive me.
   <br><br> 
  I also closely followed the creation of a new programming language <a href="https://github.com/Eclalang/Ecla" target="_blank">ECLA</a> and worked with a team to build its <a href="https://ecla.dev" target="_blank">website</a>.
